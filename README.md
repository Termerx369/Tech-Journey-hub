# Tech Journey Hub 🚀

Welcome to my **learning project**!  
This repository will track my journey into:

- Python programming 🐍
- Linux & Termux commands 📱
- Git & GitHub version control 🌍
- Cybersecurity & Bug Bounty hunting 🕵️‍♂️
- Building my own recon dashboard 💻

---

## 📌 Current Progress
- ✅ Created my first Python script (`recon.py`) that resolves domains into IP addresses.
- ✅ Successfully set up Git & GitHub on Termux.
- ⬜ Next step: Add HTTP checks to see if domains are alive.

## ⚡ Usage
Run the script with:

```bash
python recon.py example.com
